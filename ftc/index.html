              FTC stands for FIRST Tech Challenge in which we build our robots from metal peices and some 3D printed
              parts to try
              to make our robot score the most amount of points in a match with another team as a alince against two
              other teams

          In 2023-2024 season, both teams participated Spencer League Meets and Tesla Interleague Tournament
          where both teams were selected for playoffs. Alpha Intelligence was the first pick of the Semi-Finalist
          alliance,
          while Beta Bionix was the second pick of the finallist alliance. This year none of the teams were able to
          advance to
          states but in Interleagues both Alpha and Beta were doing much better and improved a lot from League Meet 1
          and 2.
          In our last comp of the season - WTI both teams were selected for Playoffs and Aloha Intellignence was the
          second
          pick of the winning alliance.
