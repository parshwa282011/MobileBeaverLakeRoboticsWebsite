                            Our team believes in being strong ambassadors for the FIRST program and our outreach
                            activities have focused on spreading awareness of FIRST. We aimed to bring more of our
                            community into FIRST and STEM through fundraisers at our school, demoing the robot, and
                            informing groups such as the Girl Scouts on the benefits of being part of the FIRST family.
                            Currently, we are working with a girls orphanage in India to spread FIRST and STEM awareness
                            We also worked with local community service oriented organizations such as Kiwanis and
                            KidVantage to give back to the community. ​ </b>
